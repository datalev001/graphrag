# Exploring and Comparing Graph-Based RAG Methods: GRAPHRAG vs. Neo4j
Exploring Microsoft's GRAPHRAG and Neo4j for Graph-Based RAG and Their Performance Compared to Traditional Retrieval Methods
In this post, I compared two graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods - Microsoft's GRAPHRAG and Neo4j - to see how they improve Large Language Models (LLMs) in retrieving and generating more accurate and context-rich responses. Traditional RAG relies on unstructured data with embeddings, while graph-based methods introduce structured relationships for deeper contextual understanding.
The first approach uses Microsoft's GRAPHRAG, which combines LLMs with graphs to extract structured data from unstructured text. I focus on GlobalSearch and LocalSearch in GRAPHRAG, exploring how community detection enhances retrieval by identifying relationships between data entities.
The second approach involves a popular graph database Neo4j, where I load data and apply graph algorithms with LLMs. Using hybrid search with vector indexing and entity embeddings, Neo4j efficiently retrieves interconnected data.
I will assess how these two graph-based RAG methods perform and compare them to traditional RAG techniques, hoping the study helps data scientists understand when to use graph-based RAG in real-world situations.
